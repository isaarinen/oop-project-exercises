Supermarket

- Variability: Things are always changing and you can't predict them

- Customers: You never know how many people will be there. It's busy after work and on weekends, but quiet other times

- Shopping carts: Some people just grab milk, others have a huge cart full of stuff. This makes checkout times random.

- Workers: Sometimes an employee might call in sick, so there are fewer cashiers than planned

- Interconnectedness: Everything affects everything else.

- Complexity: The system is complex because there are so many moving parts

If one cashier closes their lane, the lines for all the other cashiers get longer

If the deli is slow, it makes people get to the main checkout line later, which makes the line longer for everyone else who was behind them
