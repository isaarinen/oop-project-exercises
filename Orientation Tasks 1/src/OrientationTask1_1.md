A simulation is better than a real experiment for a few reasons:

- It's cheaper

- It's faster

- You can control it

- You don't mess up the real cafeteria

For sustainability, you could add these things to the simulation:

- Food Waste: You can track what food is popular in the simulation, and not make unpopular food

- Energy Use: You could track how much electricity is used, then you could test different schedules to try and save energy
